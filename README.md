Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Trash, a computer scientist and AI enthusiast. My passion for technology started way back when I first tried to fix our family PC... and ended up causing a power outage in the neighborhood. But hey, look where I am now!

## About Me

- **🌍 Where:** Currently based in Perugia, always roaming the digital realms.
- **🎓 Background:**
  - Bachelor’s in Computer Science 🎓 (Reinforcement Learning and Tetris: yes, I used AI to play games before it was cool).
  - Master’s in Artificial Intelligence 🧠 (Classifying datasets with BERT: because who doesn’t love structured data?).
- **💻 What I do:** Playing with code, making Serious Games educational, and turning complex problems into (hopefully) elegant solutions.

## My Research

I’m diving deep into **Reinforcement Learning** and its application in **Serious Games** for education. Think of it as combining the fun of gaming with the structure of learning—like tricking your brain into thinking it's playing when it's really absorbing knowledge. 

### Key Projects:

- **Serious Games Development:** Creating adaptive educational games using RL.
- **AI & Gamification:** Exploring how AI can make games both engaging and effective in learning contexts.
- **Tetris RL Agent:** My bachelor’s project where I trained an AI to (mostly) crush at Tetris.

## What I Bring to the Table

- **Languages:** Python, C#, PHP, JavaScript (and fluent in sarcasm). 
- **Frameworks & Tools:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Godot Engine.
- **Skills:** Reinforcement Learning, NLP, AI model training, making impossible bugs disappear (mostly by realizing they were typos).

## When I’m Not Coding

You might find me:
- Teaching students the wonders of Scratch (yes, coding can be fun).
- Attempting to finish yet another video game for "research purposes."
